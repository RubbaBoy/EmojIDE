# EmojIDE

An IDE in Discord emojis, for the [r/ProgrammerHumor Hackathon](https://www.programmerhumor.org/Hackathon), where the theme is "Overengineering".

## Features of the IDE:

- Over 1200 emojis with easy expandability
- A nearly fully-functional ANSI keyboard in emojis, using never-before-used techniques without reactions for anything.
- A very easy GUI framework to very easily expand upon the current GUI
- An emoji manager to automatically generate (If needed) and upload emojis used
- Multi-file editing
- JS execution and live console output
- Live, full JS syntax highlighting, all in emojis
- Multiple font support
- Chat help menus with commands to inspect emojis and their servers, with one-of-a-kind commands triggered by links in the embeds

## Requirements

The IDE is not really meant for multiple servers using it, so you need a Discord server to use it in, along with 26 other Discord servers with all 50 emoji slots open. Servers can be viewed in the future with the `!emoji info` command, as shown below:
