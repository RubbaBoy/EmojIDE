## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find something that looks like it could cause some issues, either contact me via email at [adam@yarr.is](mailto:adam@yarr.is) or on Discord, `RubbaBoy#2832`. This doesn't store any data aside from the data you type in it and your Discord user ID, and cna be deleted in the app via the Control + X keybind in the IDE. Any and all security issues will be addressed though.
